# Version: 1.1 2022-06-24 Unsetting AWS_PROFILE since, when set, it interferes with script operation
#          1.0 2022-02-02 Initial Version
#
# Purpose: For use with AFT: This script runs the local copy of TF code as if it were running within AFT pipeline.
#        * Facilitates testing of what the AFT pipline will do 
#           * Provides the ability to run terraform with custom arguments (like 'plan' or 'move') which are currently not supported within the pipeline.

# Note: Arguments to this script are passed directly to 'terraform' without parsing nor validation by this script.
#
# Prerequisites:
#    1. local copy of ct GIT repositories
#    2. local backend.tf and aft-providers.tf filled with data for the target account on which terraform is to be run
#       Hint: The contents of above files can be obtain from the logs of a previous execution of the AFT pipeline for the target account.
#    3. 'terraform' binary is available in local PATH
#    4. Recommended: .gitignore file containing 'backend.tf', 'aft_providers.tf' so the local copy of these files are not pushed back to git
